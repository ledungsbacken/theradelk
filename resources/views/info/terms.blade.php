			General information from The Rad Elk:
		</h1>
		<section id="desc" class="regular">
			<p>
				• We aim to deliver quality work in all that we do, with a focus on continuous improvement.<br><br>
• We work together with our stakeholders to provide products and services that meet or in favourable cases, exceed their expectations.<br><br>
• We select sponsoring activities that focus on opportunities related to our business and our values. A sponsoring activity should connect directly to the business; our business streams, the sectors we work for (media and entertainment industry) and other business-oriented topics like public relations, human resources etc. We sometimes select sponsoring activities related to completed The Rad Elk projects.<br><br>
• We never use sponsorships when they could have, or be perceived to have, improper influence on someone<br><br>
• We avoid the appearance of impropriety that sponsorships may create with respect to business opportunities.<br><br>
• We understand that sponsorships entail a degree of risk such as the perception of bribery<br><br>
• We do not pay individuals or agencies for information about third parties that could breach their rights.<br><br>
• Social media provides a wealth of information, some of which may legitimately be used by mainstream media.  However, the internet can present an ethical vacuum and you should not assume that simply because something appears online it can be published by us.  You must make a careful assessment of the veracity of information you find online – and of its apparent origins.  For instance, can you be sure who uploaded the information:  how do you prove that the person who apparently tweeted, commented or uploaded a photograph actually did so themselves?<br><br>
• If we publish information that turns out to be inaccurate it is important that the position be corrected.
