				Got a passion for writing, designing or telling stories? The Rad Elk is always on the lookout for new and enthusiastic contributors and therefore we have plenty spots for diligent writers, storytellers and designers. If you know anything about tech, film, music or anything linked to the entertainment industry (i.e. fashion, photography) and are driven by your ecstatic ambitions, then we might just be a match made in heaven!
			</p>
			<p>
				We’re very social elks and you can find us pretty much everywhere on the interwebz: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Discord, Snapchat and more! If it suits you best to send us your super cool application directly through one of these networks, feel free to do so, and we’ll take it from there. Otherwise, down below you’ll find an application form. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We’ll get back to you within 24 hours and take things from there.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can’t wait to hear from you and we’re eager to work together!
